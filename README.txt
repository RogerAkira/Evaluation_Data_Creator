Welcome to the README
There are two main code. In the future I will create a easier way to run the program. A GUI and single folder/file name input.



The two codes are as follows:

csvconvolver.py -- Batch convolves a Impulse Response with a Clean Speech file
rnmixer.py  --Batch mixes Audio with a Road noise/ enviromental noise


csvconvolver.py
Takes:
File location off Clean Speech
File name of Clean Speech

File Location of Impulse Response
filename of Impulse Response

File Output location. -- Not Neccessary but recomended (will place output on root)




rnmixer.py
Takes:
File location off audio file
File name of audio file

File Location of noise
Filename of noise

File Output location. -- Not Neccessary but recomended (will place output on root)
